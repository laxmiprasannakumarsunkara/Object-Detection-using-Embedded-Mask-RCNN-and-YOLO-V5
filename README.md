# Object-Detection-using-Embedded-Mask-RCNN-and-YOLO-V5
This project describes about the detecting of an object by embedding of two techniques Mask-Rcnn and yolo-v5.When humans look at images or video, we can recognize and locate objects. The goal of This project is to replicate this intelligence using a computer.
