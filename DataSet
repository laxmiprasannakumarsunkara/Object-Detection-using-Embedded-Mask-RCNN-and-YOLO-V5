Custom data set
Creating an custom data set:-For creating an custom data set I have used an python package called labelimg.
Labelimg:-LabelImg is a graphical image annotation tool. It is written in Python and uses Qt for its graphical interface. Annotations are saved as XML files text files.These files are used as 
labels for our images .This labels are used for training the data set.
